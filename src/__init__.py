"""Core package for melanoma classification experiments.

The ``src`` namespace mirrors the classic Cookiecutter data-science layout and
groups together configuration, dataset preparation, modelling, plotting, and
service integration modules. Importing ``src`` ensures these helpers can be
referenced from notebooks without altering ``sys.path`` manually.
