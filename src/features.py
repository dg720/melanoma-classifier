"""Feature engineering utilities for melanoma image modelling.

The project currently relies on end-to-end convolutional neural networks, so
no standalone feature transformations are implemented yet. This module acts as
an extension point for handcrafted descriptors or augmentation pipelines that
may be introduced in subsequent iterations.
